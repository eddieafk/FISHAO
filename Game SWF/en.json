  "fish_desc_1000": "The Greenland Shark, a gigantic monster that is native to the cold waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. They live farther north than any other shark species. They also have the most poisonous meat of all sharks, but are consumed by people anyway as there some methods to remove its toxin prior to consumption. Greenland Sharks are not considered dangerous to humans, but they live in extremely cold waters where people usually don\u2019t swim anyway, so\u2026 Who knows?",
  "fish_desc_1001": "The Smalltooth Sawfish has bottom-dwelling habits and is usually seen in shallow tropical and subtropical waters in some coastal parts of the Atlantic Ocean. It is quite similar to the Common Sawfish in shape, but it has a few more teeth at each side of the rostrum, which looks like a saw. It has been listed as a critically endangered species.",
  "fish_desc_1002": "Common Sawfishes live in tropical and subtropical coastal regions across the globe, but they also ascend river courses in some situations. Although it is present in such a wide area of the planet, it is listed now as a critically endangered species. Adult individuals may grow to enormous sizes and they all have a rostral blade (beak) with several pointy spines.",
  "fish_desc_1003": "The Spotted Sicklefish can be identified by its \u201chump\u201d, by the pointy pectoral fins and also by the dark spots, obviously. This species is native to temperate and tropical waters of the Indo-West Pacific. Despite the relatively small mouth and non-aggressive look, it feeds on invertebrates and also on other fishes that live near the sea floor. Often consumed by people.",
  "fish_desc_1004": "This eel species was accurately named: Blind Cave Eels are blind indeed, and live in subterranean waters in Australia. These creatures lack pigmentation and are perfectly adapted to live in such dark \u2014 or, in some cases, totally lightless \u2014 environments. But being blind doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t find their prey\u2026 Yeah, these guys are carnivores!",
  "fish_desc_1005": "The coloration of the Golden Trevally is perhaps one of its most interesting characteristics: juveniles are bright yellow with vertical black stripes on the sides of the body, but they slowly change in color as they mature; a process in which goldish-yellow turns into silver, with almost no sign of the black stripes on fully-changed specimens. Young individuals live among tentacles of jellyfish while adults usually swim around big fishes, such as sharks, to gain protection from likely predators.",
  "fish_desc_1006": "The Bonnethead Shark is a kind of hammerhead shark and is known as the one with the smallest cephalofoil (hammerhead). Also, the front of their heads is semi-circular in outline, while no other hammerhead shark presents this shape. This species inhabits parts of the Western Atlantic and Eastern Pacific Oceans.",
  "fish_desc_1007": "The Winghead Shark is a kind of hammerhead shark and its name derives from its incredibly large cephalofoil (hammerhead). But it\u2019s not only known for its intriguing appearance: this species is widely fished and several parts of its body are commercialized separately for different purposes. Due to over-exploitation, it is now considered as a near-threatened species.",
  "fish_desc_1008": "This fish is extremely rare and was discovered recently in the waters of Rio Negro, in Brazil. Little is known about this tiny creature up to now, but it has nocturnal habits and most of its body is transparent, except for its orange-reddish head and blue belly, therefore it was named Cyanogaster noctivaga, which means \u201cBlue-bellied Night Wanderer\u201d.",
  "fish_desc_1009": "This deep-water marine fish is native to the Atlantic Ocean. Fully-developed specimens usually stay in the deep, but young individuals have been seen swimming around floating debris, such as wood barrels, in some areas on the coast of the USA, hence the name American Barrelfish. Despite the name, this species is present in a wide part of the Atlantic Ocean and individuals have been seen in many countries, including  European ones.",
  "fish_desc_101": "One of the smaller species from the Catfish family. If you know the catfish species, you know what to use to catch it!",
  "fish_desc_1010": "This fish inhabits some rivers in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana, in Africa, and is a member of the family Mormyridae (freshwater elephantfish). Even though it doesn\u2019t have such long snout that is very particular of its family, the Marcusenius Furcidens can be recognized by its protruding lower jaw. This genus was named after an ichthyologist called J. Marcusen.",
  "fish_desc_1011": "An incredibly small fish from the Orinoco River basin, in South America. Its body is partially transparent with reddish coloration and it can be identified by the black spot behind the gill-plate and the black band on the dorsal fin. This species is considerably popular in the aquarium trade.",
  "fish_desc_1012": "\"The Black Diamond Cichlid is endemic to Madagascar, where it is known as \u201cMarakely\u201d. Adult dominant individuals are black in color, covered with iridescent spots. \nMales in captivity tend to develop a hump on the top of the head.
